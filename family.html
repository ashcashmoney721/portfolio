        <h2>Michelle Kramaric, Roommate</h2>
        <p>Michelle hails from Chicago, the windy city; and she is quite proud of that statistic. There's nothing that Michelle likes to do more then cuddle the dog, watch Pitbulls and Parolees, and eat ramen noodle soup.  When we do venture out of the house, we like live music, breweries, and art and cultural works.  Michelle has her Master's in Public Health and is currently helping our nation fight COV-19 and infectious diseases.</p></div>

            <h2>Ariana Grande, Beloved Pitbull</h2>
            <p>Ariana Grande Kramaric is a five year old Red-Nosed Pit Bull.  We have had her for around 4 months; she started out as a notorious foster dog, and, we fell in love and became co-parents.  Ariana definitely keeps us going and out of the house.</p></div>

            <p>Mike, Ashley's Dad, still resides in Kansas, in the same small town that Ashley grew up in.  He is a successful business owner selling new and used vehicles, most notably Subarus. He is now at the age where you can find him on the golf course or on vacation more likely than you would find him at work.  Truly living the good life!</p></div>

            <h2>Carolyn Money, Mother, and Ashley Enjoying the Summer Day</h2>
            <p>Before separating from Ashley's father a few years back, Carolyn worked alongside him at the car dealership performing all the accounting roles. She took that role and ran with it, working for three other large dealerships across the Midwest.  She is quite excited as she is making a career transition into automotive consulting, so most of her time is spent enjoying the country while working hard.  Carolyn is a big fan of animals, and she eagerly awaits her return to her dog, Baxter, a Goldendoodle, upon arriving home after a few weeks gone.  Carolyn is also an exceptional cook and decorator.</p></div>

                <p>Michael, Ashley's brother, has decidedd to forgo the big city and he plans on following in his father's car business legacy. He truly eats, sleeps, and drinks all things cars, so he was quite excited this year when he bought a new Subaru racing vehicle. Michael also enjoys working in hospitality as a side job.</p></div>
